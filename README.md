<h2>About</h2>

The inspiration for this came about 5 years ago when I realized just how structured most popular forms of music are. I figured I could create a program to genereate music by allowing the user to define the structure (or boundaries), and then letting the generator work within those boundaries to create a song.

My ultimate goal was to see it as a pipeline into a DAW, like: configuration files -> composition generator -> MIDI file -> DAW, but, I'm sure someone else could set it up to feed the MIDI files right into some other program to be immediately rendered as audio.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

**Only supports Major and Minor Scales**

It's hardcoded to only work with major and minor scales, at least until I can up with a generic solution regarding the use of other scales and modes. This covers the majority of popular western music styles, anyway, but it's something I would like to change.

**There's no percusion.**

Because percussion is a special case I left it out, but, it is priority #1.

**There's no swagger.**

Things like bends and slides are dependent on the type of instrument and the notes that the instrument can play, so, I opted to leave them out for the time being.
